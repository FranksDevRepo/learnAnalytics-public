# LearnAI Materials (formerly Learn Analytics)

This site is a map of learning content produced by and curated by the LearnAI team in Microsoft Engineering. We are currently focused on building out materials to help developers build AI-oriented applications on Azure. The goal of this page is to provide
a single place where you can go to navigate the materials that we develop. 

This site uses github pages to present information, and as such, the most relevant information is avialable in the [gh-pages branch][gh-pages], and is most easily navigated through using its [rendering][learnai-site].

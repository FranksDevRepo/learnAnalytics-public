# Abstract

This site is a map of data science learning content produced by and curated by the learnAnalytics team at Microsoft. The goal is to provide
a single place where you can go to navigate the materials that we develop. In order to facilitate this, we have broken the 
text into several sections:

- *Certification*: Provides links to materials that are relevant for preparing for certification exams.
- *Microsoft R and SQL Server ML Services*: Provides links to materials that are most relevant to Microsoft R and SQL Server ML Services
- *Cortana Intelligence Suite (CIS)*: Provides links to materials relevant to other products, with a focus on CIS.


## Certification

If you are an aspirant learning to gain skills around data science or big data, you can get more information from
our professional programs on [data science](https://academy.microsoft.com/en-us/professional-program/data-science/),
powered by courses on [EdX.org](https://www.edx.org/course/?search_query=Microsoft&subject=Data%20Analysis%20%26%20Statistics).

If you are a professional looking for more information on how you can demonstrate your expertise, 
you can get more information on our analytics-oriented certifications [here](http://learnanalytics.microsoft.com/home/certifications).

In order to help prepare for some of those exams, we have prepared the following:

- [Community Guide](cert_guides/certification_70-773_community_guide) for [Exam 70-773: Analyzing Big Data with Microsoft R Server (beta)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/learning/exam-70-773.aspx).
- [Community Guide](cert_guides/certification_70-774_community_guide.html) for [Exam 70-774: Perform Cloud Data Science with Azure Machine Learning (beta)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/learning/exam-70-774.aspx).
- [Community Guide](cert_guides/certification_70-775_community_guide) for [Exam 70-775: Perform Data Engineering on Microsoft Azure HDInsight (beta)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/learning/exam-70-775.aspx).

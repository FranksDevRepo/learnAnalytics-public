# LearnAI Materials (formerly Learn Analytics)

This site is a map of learning content produced by and curated by the LearnAI team in Microsoft Engineering. We are currently focused on building out materials to help developers build AI-oriented applications on Azure. The goal of this page is to provide
a single place where you can go to navigate the materials that we develop. 

# AI-oriented materials

- [Bootcamp: Developing applications using Cognitive Services, Azure Bot Services, and Azure Search][emergingbootcamp]
- [Bootcamp: Developing and Operationalizing Models using Azure Machine Learning][probootcamp]
- [Logging and Testing with Azure Bot Service][advancedbot]
- [Building Computer Vision Application Leveraging Custom Vision Service][buildingcomputervision]
- [Using Azure Machine Learning for AI Workloads][amlforai]
- [Artificial Intelligence on IaaS++][aioniaas]
- [Building Custom Computer Vision with Azure Machine Learning][customcomputervisionwithaml]
- [Building Custom Text Analytics solutions using Azure Machine Learning][customtextanalyticswithaml]
- [Building Custom Forecasting Applications using Azure Machine Learning][customtimeseriesforcastingwithaml]
- [Designing and Architecting Intelligent Agents][designingandarchitectingintelligentagents]

# AI learning paths

In addition to the courses above, there are [several learning paths][ai-lp-home] targeted towards developers interested in AI. 

- [Getting Started with AI and Cognitive Systems][ai-lp-gettingstarted]
- [Creating Artificial Intelligence applications with Natural Language Processing - With Cognitive Services API's][ai-lp-nlp]
- [Building Deep-Learning Solutions with Cognitive Toolkit][ai-lp-deeplearning]

# Older materials

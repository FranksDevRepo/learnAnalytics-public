# LearnAI Materials (formerly Learn Analytics)

This site is a map of learning content produced by and curated by the LearnAI team in Microsoft Engineering. We are currently focused on building out materials to help developers build AI-oriented applications on Azure. The goal of this page is to provide
a single place where you can go to navigate the materials that we develop. 

# AI-oriented materials

- [Azure Cognitive Services Bootcamp: Developing Applications with Cognitive Services, Azure Bot Service, and Azure Search][emergingbootcamp]
- [Designing and Architecting Intelligent Agents][designingandarchitectingintelligentagents]
- [Building an Enterprise Cognitive Search Solution][buildinganenterprisecognitivesearchsolution]
- [Knowledge Mining Bootcamp](https://azure.github.io/LearnAI-KnowledgeMiningBootcamp/)
- [Anomaly Detection and Predictive Maintenance](https://azure.github.io/LearnAI-ADPM/)

# AI learning paths

In addition to the courses above, there are [several learning paths][ai-lp-home] targeted towards developers interested in AI. 

- [Getting Started with AI and Cognitive Systems][ai-lp-gettingstarted]
- [Creating Artificial Intelligence applications with Natural Language Processing - With Cognitive Services API's][ai-lp-nlp]

# Older materials

Several courses have been deprecated due to recent product updates, including the LearnAI bootcamp for Professional AI Developers. The deprecated content is still available in this section though it will not be maintained.
If you're looking for earlier materials focused on data science, Business Analytics, Microsoft R Server, and Certification, please see [here][older_learnai_materials].
